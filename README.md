## Prerequisites

This image assumes that you are using a reverse proxy such as [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) and optionally the [Let's Encrypt Proxy Companion @ https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) in order to serve your pages. However, it will run just fine on it's own if you map appropriate ports.

This image also needs a Seperate MariaDB Container and optional memcached container.

If using an SSL Reverse proxy the following must be added to the proxy! (vhost.d/sitename.domain.com)

````
proxy_set_header    Host    $host;
proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP   $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_pass_header   Set-Cookie;
````

## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/ryanwclark/osticket) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull ryanwclark/osticket
```

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

## Configuration

### Data-Volumes

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| `/www/logs` | Nginx and php-fpm logfiles |

### Database

Create a linked MariaDB Database and the image will automatically populate the DB upon startup.
